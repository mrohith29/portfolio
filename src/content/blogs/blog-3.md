It took much time for me to write my third blog and not because of I don't have anything to blog instead I had many other things to work on and even I am trying to develop habit of blogging atleast from now because I think blogging helps me to keep track of my things what I do, what I have been, What I could/can/should be in my future. 

The things which I am doing/focusing and needed/helpful for my future development are:
- Problem Solving
- Industry Experience (Working on realtime project)
- Machine Learning

1) Problem Solving:
    
    Problem Solving skill I think are very much needed for me to land into any job or role including the specialization for that particular role/position. Learning DSA, practising different level questions understanding the problem and ability to come-up with an efficient solution is not only important for cracking an interview but also applying for any algorithm I design or use.

2) Industry Experience: 

    I am happy to share that it has been 5 months me working professionally, applying my ideas and skills to help other Organization to grow, I am even making good use of money I earn with my internship, I hope the experience I make with it and the amount of time I spend with it will be worthy and give me a good perspective of my future goals.

3) Machine Learning:
   
   This is the field I am getting very much intrested in to persue my career, because seeing the impact it is creating on each section of all the industries and it's the scope of AI in the future of mankind it's so fasinating and overwhelming. I am trying to understand the low level concepts of ML their low level implimentation so that I can get a very good basic understanding of it's concepts


# Things I should continue to do 

- Write blogs regularly
- Improve in solving problems
- Perform better professionally
- Dig deeper into ML
- Be humble and things about things from the lowest level possible :)

And that's all for this blog
