The feel of using the things which are created with your hands by spending your time is quite beautiful. Wether it is a plugin, application, UI, or even a wallpaper the feel with which you have created the environment of development and the things you tooks into the consideration for accomplishmnet of the product will always be remmembered whenever I see or use them.

And I want everyone to experience that feeling.

There's noneed to build big-big things inorder to create your things. You can can start your journey with a small and simple step ie., desiging your own wallpaper.

You might have invested much of your time searching for good wallpaper which describes your personality, or character, or your motivation, or anything. But instead of browsig the perfect image you could design the wallpaper as you want by just using paint app which is a default app in windows or you can use any similar apps in your OS.

But the things you need in the process are :
- patience
- interest

You invest your time add all the scrap you find it useful and insert them.

This is one of the wallpapers which I designed might descibe my thoughts

Even I found nothing in the internet which accurately describes you so I took a step to design my own.


So do whatever you want and taste the dish cooked by you.
