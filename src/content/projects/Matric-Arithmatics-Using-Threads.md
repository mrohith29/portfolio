The general arithmatic operation uses single thread and loops calculate every single output and bind them, it's time consuming when the order of the matrices are bigger, but assigining each thread a function and calculating each value with single thread would fasten the calculation and reduce the output time. Therefore multiprocessing is better than monoprocessing
